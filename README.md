# Intro to HTML and CSS

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's used to structure content on the web.
A HTML file is made up of elements. You create elements using tags.
Tags look like this <tag></tag>
Tags can have attributes.
`<html>` - Parent element
`<body></body>` - Child element
</html>
This is just a repository documenting my learning journey on HTML and CSS.

### HTML Tags
- Heading tags - h1 to h6

## Semantic elements
Elements which have dedicated functions
- `header` - introductory content about your website/web page
- `nav` - contains navigation links to other parts/pages of your website
- `footer` - contains quick links and is normally found at the bottom of your website
- `main` - contains the main content of the web page
- `section` - a tag that is used to group closely related content
- `div` - a tag used to group elements
- `article` - used to wrap blogs or written articles
