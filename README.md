# Intro to HTML and CSS

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's used to structure content on the web.
A HTML file is made up of elements. You create elements using tags.
Tags look like this <tag></tag>
Tags can have attributes.
<html> - Parent element
<body></body> - Child element
</html>
This is just a repository documenting my learning journey on HTML and CSS.
